A couple of weeks ago, I was looking into the housing market. I found out about Rocket Mortgage, a company that lets people buy homes with a 1% down payment. I also read about how foreclosures are going up, especially in low income parts of Florida where these loans are popular. This interactive map, highlighting foreclosure rates per zip code, left me in awe of its informational efficiency. I pondered how much effort must've gone into making such a visual. That was before I learned about Tableau. This morning, I made a similar map using Tableau in less than an hour. I'm really excited to learn more about this tool!

## The Project

For this project, I will focus on trends in Massachusetts public schools using the "Massachusetts Public Schools Data" dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains a range of information including student demographics, school performance, graduation rates, and college attendance statistics. The ultimate objective is to uncover patterns and discern which factors contribute most significantly to underperformance in Massachusetts educational institutions.

## Findings

Here are some interesting findings from this project:
