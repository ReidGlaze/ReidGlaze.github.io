This data science project centered around predicting bike rental demand, a pivotal component of urban life, using a dataset sourced from Seoul, South Korea. Initially, during a class taught by Dr. David Quigley, I used Python as my primary tool for data cleaning and feature engineering.

Recently, after acquiring SQL skills, I decided to revisit the project. The goal was to identify hidden patterns and create accurate prediction models using both SQL for data querying and manipulation, and Python for data exploration, preprocessing, and feature engineering. Together with machine learning techniques, I was able to generate precise forecasts and gain a deeper understanding of the bike rental dynamics in Seoul.

This endeavor represents a fusion of my earlier work and new skills, leveraging the synergy of SQL and Python to improve data management efficiency and uncover more profound insights from the Seoul-based dataset, which could potentially shift our understanding of urban transportation dynamics.
