Our first stop is a bubble chart illustrating the average assists, rebounds, and points scored by each player. Points are on the x-axis, assists on the y-axis, and the size of the bubbles represents the number of rebounds. Player positions are indicated by colors.

One player stands out as an outlier - Nikola Jokic. As a center, he impressively recorded far more assists than the average center, showcasing his playmaking ability. Additionally, his rebounding prowess further cements him as a formidable force on the court.

## Slide 2: Scoring Dynamics Across Teams

Next, we explore scoring dynamics within teams with a stacked bar chart. The LA Clippers emerge as a powerhouse, leading in average points. Even lesser-known players from their team contributed significantly, highlighting their collective strength.

On the other hand, teams like Denver face challenges, with some players scoring only an average of 1 point or less. A notable exception is Kawhi Leonard from the LA Clippers, who dominated with an impressive average of 34.5 points per game, outshining all other players in the playoffs.

## Slide 3: Beyond the Arc - 3-Point Prowess

In this heat map, we explore the 3-point shooting abilities of each player, filtering out those with extremely low attempts for accuracy. The small forward position of the LA Clippers, led by Kawhi Leonard, stands out with an impressive 60 percent success rate and an average of 5 attempts per game.

Another player worth noting is the small forward from the Milwaukee Bucks, boasting a remarkable 49 percent success rate on an average of 20.2 3-point attempts per game.

## Slide 4: Assists by Position

Assists play a pivotal role in team strategy, and this treemap breaks down assists by position. As expected, point guards dominate this category, showcasing their essential role in facilitating teamwork. One standout player, Trae Young, secures the highest average assists, reflecting his crucial role in guiding his team's offense.

An interesting observation is once again Nikola Jokic, the center who surprisingly secured the second-highest number of assists overall, an exceptional feat for a position not typically known for playmaking abilities.

## Slide 5: Unraveling the NBA Finals Stars
