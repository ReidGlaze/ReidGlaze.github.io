## Project Overview
As a key contributor to the Reconfigurable CubeSat Swarm project, I played a crucial role as the Financial Manager. Our team's mission was to simplify and reduce the cost of sending large structures into space. We designed, developed, and tested independent CubeSat units with the ability to reconfigure themselves. This unique feature allowed us to create a modular assembly that could adapt its shape to perform a variety of functions. Our project, sponsored by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, demonstrated our commitment to developing innovative, cost-effective solutions for space exploration.
