Have you ever wondered what makes one school excel while another struggles? I looked into Massachusetts public schools' data, using the powerful visualization tool, Tableau, to answer this question. It allowed me to analyze and understand the complex patterns affecting educational performance. My insights are captured in an interactive dashboard, including a map of Massachusetts where each zip code is represented by a clickable region. Feel free to explore this dashboard by clicking on the image below to uncover the fascinating trends that affect this state's education system.
