## Introduction

This report focuses on analyzing a dataset related to the mining process. The primary objectives are understanding patterns in the mining process over time and building a predictive model for `% Iron Concentrate` and `% Silica Concentrate`.

## Time-Based Data Analysis

### Data Loading and Preprocessing
The dataset was read from a CSV file, which contains various parameters of the mining process. Special emphasis was placed on the 'date' column, extracting features such as the hour of the day, day of the week, month, and a weekend indicator.

### Visualizations
Multiple visualizations were generated to understand the patterns in `% Silica` and `% Iron` concentrates based on different time granularities such as hour of the day and day of the week. The visuals provide insights into how the concentrations change over time.
