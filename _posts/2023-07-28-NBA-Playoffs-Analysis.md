The 2023 NBA playoffs provided an exciting display of talent, and Tableau's powerful data visualization capabilities enable us to delve into the numbers behind the star performances. In this tableau story, we'll take a closer look at player data to uncover interesting insights and standout performances from the tournament.

## Slide 1: Charting the All-Around Players


Their initial point of focus is a bubble chart that depicts the average assists, rebounds, and points earned by every player. Points find their place on the x-axis, assists on the y-axis, and the magnitude of the bubbles denotes the quantity of rebounds. The different positions of the players are differentiated through color codes.

There's one player who breaks the mold - Nikola Jokic. Despite his role as a center, Jokic's assist record is remarkably higher than the average player in his position, effectively spotlighting his capacity as a playmaker. His aptitude for rebounds additionally bolsters his standing as a significant player on the field.

Included in the chart are regression lines for each position. Based on these regression lines, it was inferred that point guards generally account for the most assists in relation to points. Meanwhile, centers take the lead in gathering the most rebounds. In an unexpected revelation, shooting guards, small forwards, power forwards, and centers appear to have similar ratios of assists to points.

## Slide 2: Scoring Dynamics Across Teams


Next, we explore scoring dynamics within teams with a stacked bar chart. The LA Clippers emerge as a powerhouse, leading in average points. Even lesser-known players from their team contributed significantly, highlighting their collective strength.

On the other hand, teams like Denver face challenges, with some players scoring only an average of 1 point or less. A notable exception is Kawhi Leonard from the LA Clippers, who dominated with an impressive average of 34.5 points per game, outshining all other players in the playoffs.

## Slide 3: Beyond the Arc - 3-Point Prowess


In this heat map, we explore the 3-point shooting abilities of each player, filtering out those with extremely low attempts for accuracy. The small forward position of the LA Clippers, led by Kawhi Leonard, stands out with an impressive 60 percent success rate and an average of 5 attempts per game.

Another player worth noting is the small forward from the Milwaukee Bucks, boasting a remarkable 49 percent success rate on an average of 20.2 3-point attempts per game.

## Slide 4: Assists by Position


Assists play a pivotal role in team strategy, and this treemap breaks down assists by position. As expected, point guards dominate this category, showcasing their essential role in facilitating teamwork. One standout player, Trae Young, secures the highest average assists, reflecting his crucial role in guiding his team's offense.

An interesting observation is once again Nikola Jokic, the center who surprisingly secured the second-highest number of assists overall, an exceptional feat for a position not typically known for playmaking abilities.

In the NBA Finals, we focus on the top 5 players from the two competing teams. Nikola Jokic shines as the 7th player to achieve two triple-doubles in an NBA Finals, solidifying his reputation as an all-around player. His average stats reflect his awe-inspiring performances throughout the tournament.
