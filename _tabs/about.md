Hello! I'm Reid. I was born and raised in North Carolina, but these days, I call the beautiful state of Colorado home. I'm passionate about skiing and weightlifting, and I love spending time in the great outdoors, especially the mountains!

I have a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Colorado, with a specialization in machine learning. Through their flexible "Flex" program, I had the opportunity to expand my horizons and take classes outside of my department.

As someone who believes in continuous growth and learning, I'm currently enhancing my abilities in SQL, R, and Tableau by participating in an engaging data bootcamp. 

This website is my digital portfolio, where I document my projects and experiences. It's a snapshot of my journey so far and the progress I'm making in my field.

As for my career goals, I'm setting my sights on a data analyst position, hoping to use this as a stepping stone towards becoming becoming a data scientist. It's a path I'm dedicated to, and I'm eager to see where this journey will lead. Thank you for joining me on this adventure!

### Feel free to reach out to me!
