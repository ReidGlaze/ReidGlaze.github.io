In today's healthcare industry, the sheer volume of data generated can provide invaluable insights into patient outcomes, particularly for those managing chronic conditions such as diabetes. A crucial factor to consider is the length of hospital stays, as this can directly impact both patient care and hospital efficiency.

In this project, I will be assuming the role of a data analyst at a hospital, utilizing a comprehensive dataset from a decade-long study carried out across 130 U.S. hospitals. The dataset specifically pertains to the hospital records of diabetic patients.

I'll be utilizing Structured Query Language (SQL), a robust tool for handling and interrogating complex datasets, to navigate through seven unique scenarios. Each scenario will necessitate the use of various SQL functions, such as JOINs, UNION, CASE WHEN, CONCAT, and more, to answer a specific question posed by the hospital administration. The questions range from exploring the duration of hospital stays to generating detailed reports on specific patient demographics.

## The Project

### Tools & Data Set

For this project Azure Data Studio was used. The MySQL plugin was used in order to use the MySQL format instead of T-SQL. The data, drawn from a decade-long study spanning 1999 to 2008 and involving over 130 hospitals in the United States, specifically features hospital stay records for diabetic patients. The dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/iabhishekofficial/prediction-on-hospital-readmission/data?select=diabetic_data.csv), while the comprehensive hospital records and the study itself can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008).
